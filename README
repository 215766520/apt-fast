About:
====================

apt-fast is a shellscript wrapper for apt-get that can drastically improve apt download
times by downloading packages in parallel, with multiple connections per package.

====================
Setup/Install:
====================

Some distros, such as PCLinuxOS include apt-fast in their repos. For those of you
who need to manually install it, simply download apt-fast.sh and, as root, move it
to /usr/sbin or /usr/bin. Then, rename it apt-fast, and chmod+ x apt-fast as root.

You need to have a good download manager installed - aria2c and axel are favorites
for this script. Make sure and open apt-fast in a text editor and uncomment the line
for your download manager before using it, and configure the other options!

Then, you should be ready to use it - simply run apt-fast instead of apt-get any time
you find yourself needing to manage packages!
