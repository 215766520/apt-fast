About:
====================

apt-fast is a shellscript wrapper for apt-get that can drastically improve apt download
times by downloading packages in parallel, with multiple connections per package.

BE SURE to look at the tags in the repo, as some are distro specific, and may contain
files you need for autocompletion.

====================
Setup/Install:
====================

Some distros, such as PCLinuxOS include apt-fast in their repos. For those of you
who need to manually install it, download it and perform the following:

cp ./apt-fast /usr/sbin/
chmod +x /usr/sbin/apt-fast

You need to have a good download manager installed - aria2c and axel are favorites
for this script. Make sure and open apt-fast in a text editor and uncomment the line
for your download manager before using it, and configure the other options!

apt-get install aria2c
OR
apt-get install axel

Then, you should be ready to use it - simply run apt-fast instead of apt-get any time
you find yourself needing to manage packages!

Debian (and possibly others) autocompletion:

cp ./apt-fast.comp /etc/bash_completion.d/apt-fast
. /etc/bash_completion
